# App2MobileAppDev
App 2 for CS 4530 mobile app development class

This app is a refactoring of Example35 from class. This refactoring now uses Jetpack Compose to create the UI for the app. Additionally, instead of using LiveData for getting and updating data from the weather database, it instead uses StateFlows to do it.
